# ImageMagick CLI extensions

_Additions and tweaks to ImageMagick's CLI tools (e.g. convert, mogrify)._

These are some personal aliases, shortcuts, and extensions that make (my) work with the [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) command-line utilities easier and faster. Some of them may be specific to my environment and workflow, but maybe someone finds a valuable nugget in there.

### Installation

Download all / some selected extensions (note that some have dependencies, though) and put them somewhere in your `PATH`.
